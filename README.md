# DataStructures
Java implementations of various data structures.

## Red-black Tree

Implementation of a red-black tree, a kind of self-balancing binary
search tree where balance is achieved through maintaining certain
node colouring properties.  Search, insertion and deletion are all
performed in O(log n) time.

## Heap

and pop operations are all performed in O(log n) time.
