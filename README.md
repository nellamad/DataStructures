# DataStructures
Java implementations of various data structures.

## [Red-black Tree](https://github.com/nellamad/DataStructures/blob/master/src/main/java/DataStructures/RedBlackTree.java) ([tests](https://github.com/nellamad/DataStructures/blob/master/src/test/java/DataStructures/RedBlackTreeTest.java))

Implementation of a red-black tree, a kind of self-balancing binary
search tree where balance is achieved through maintaining certain
node colouring properties.  Search, insertion and deletion are all
performed in O(log n) time.

## [Heap](https://github.com/nellamad/DataStructures/blob/master/src/main/java/DataStructures/Heap.java) ([tests](https://github.com/nellamad/DataStructures/blob/master/src/test/java/DataStructures/HeapTest.java))

An implementation of a min-heap using an arraylist as the underlying data structure.  Push
and pop operations are all performed in O(log n) time.
